# Monet GAN – Style Transfer

This project participates in the Kaggle competition
"I'm Something of a Painter Myself".

## Problem
The goal is to use Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to translate real photos into Monet-style paintings.

## Dataset
The dataset contains 300 Monet paintings and approximately 7,000 real photos, all resized to 256×256 RGB images.

## Model
A CycleGAN architecture is used for unpaired image-to-image translation.

## Results
The model achieved a public MiFID score of 207.73 on Kaggle.
